### 📁  〢 Setting Up

> Install [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.16.0/)

> IMPORTANT: When installing Node.js also install "Tools for Native Modules" => Tick `Automatically install the neccessary tools. Note that this will also install Chocolatey. The script will pop-up in a new window after the installation completes.`
>

> 
> Unzip **node_modules.zip** archive in same path
>
> Place your webhook in **_config.js_**
>
> Run **_node build.js_** in cmd path and wait for **_1336-win.exe_** to be built.
